## Bing userstyle for links

The Bing search engine has a usability issue that stems from missing presentational hints on links. All links are colored as purple,
giving no indication of which links are visited and which are not.

This userstyle sets the color of unvisited links to blue and visited links to purple as per standard guidelines: https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/rendering.html#phrasing-content-3.
